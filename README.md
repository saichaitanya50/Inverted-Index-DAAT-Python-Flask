# Inverted-Index-DAAT-Python-Flask

This repository contains the implementation of an Inverted Index using Linked Lists and Flask in Python. It allows for efficient Boolean queries using a Document-at-a-time (DAAT) strategy, ideal for understanding Information Retrieval concepts.

* Developed an Inverted Index using Python and Flask, integrating Linked Lists for efficient data management.
* Implemented a Document-at-a-Time (DAAT) Boolean query processing system for advanced information retrieval.
* Crafted a text preprocessing module for document tokenization and normalization.
* Enabled interactive querying through a Flask web application, demonstrating web development and information retrieval skills.

## Files Description

* **src/indexer.py:** Contains the core logic for building the inverted index.
* **src/linkedlist.py:** Implements the linked list data structure used in the index.
* **src/preprocessor.py:** Handles the preprocessing of documents, including tokenization and normalization.
* **src/run_project.py:** The main script to run the project. It sets up the Flask application and endpoints for querying.
